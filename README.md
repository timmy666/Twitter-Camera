A tweeting camera app for Pi (great for events) created with Liz Smart, Sarah Sheerman-Chase, Greg Annandale and Emma Norton

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

Hardware
1 x Raspberry Pi camera module
Software

See more information on checking you have these packages installed, and how to install them, on the software installation page.

First of all, you'll need to set up a Twitter account, get your API keys and test the connection. Follow the Getting Started with the Twitter API resource before you start.
